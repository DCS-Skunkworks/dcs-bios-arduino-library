# DCS-BIOS Arduino Library

This is an Arduino library that makes it easy to write sketches that talk to DCS-BIOS.

For more information and documentation, see the [DCS-BIOS FlightPanels Project](https://github.com/DCSFlightpanels) and the (WIP) Arduino wiki here: https://github.com/talbotmcinnis/dcs-bios-arduino-library/wiki.

## Origins

DCS-BIOS was originally developed here, [DCS-BIOS project.](https://github.com/dcs-bios/dcs-bios)  DCS-BIOS Flightpanels forked all of DCS-BIOS in order to initially provide support for Saitek Flight Panels.  As of Nov, 2020, the original project has received limited support (despite a major update for HUB), and FlightPanels is gaining in popularity due to it's support.

## Support

This is a community maintained plugin.  Support is best found at the DCS-Flightpanels discord channel.
