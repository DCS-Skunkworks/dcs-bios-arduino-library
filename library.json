DCS-BIOS is a piece of software that can extract data from DCS: World and sends them to an Arduino. It also accepts commands over the serial port. This library talks to DCS-BIOS and allows you to connect any component your Arduino can communicate with to your virtual cockpit. This is a fork of the Skunkworks dcs-bios library which additions and modificatíons for DCSBIOSKit hardware.",
